This assignment uses many csv files (from the course repository).  **Do not include** these with your homework, and do not store them on your mp248 repository.  The issue here is that if you store large files in your mp248 repository it slows down the grading script substantially and makes it more difficult for us to give you timely feedback before the due date. In your code, just point to the location (outside of your personal repository) when you need them.\n"

    "In this problem we ask you to use Sympy to find:\n",
    "\n",
    " (a) The points in the plane where Newton's method fails after 2 or 3 iterations. Notice that $N(z) = \\frac{2z^2+1}{3z^2}$ which is well-defined as long as $z \\neq 0$.  Thus Newton's method fails on one iteration only for $z=0$. Find both closed-form expressions for your answers as well as floating-point approximations. Print the approximations in your notebook. Use the Python casting technique **complex(z)** to convert the Sympy complex number **z** to a floating point approximation. In your notebook also count the number of points, i.e. write \"The number of points where Newton's method fails after exactly two iterations is . . .\"\n",
    " \n",
    " (b) The points in the plane where Newton's method is periodic of period 2 or 3.  A point is periodic of period 1 means $N(z) = z$.  Periodic of period 2 means $N(N(z))=z$ and $N(z) \\neq z$.  Periodic of period 3 means $N(N(N(z))) = z$ while $N(z) \\neq z$ and $N(N(z))\\neq z$. \n",
    " \n",
    " So for example, the points of period $1$ are the solution to the equation\n",
    " $$z = N(z) = z - \\frac{z^3-1}{3z^2}$$\n",
    " which we can see are the roots of the original equation $z^3-1$. Similarly write-out the number of periodic points of period exactly 2, similarly for period 3.\n",
    " \n",
    " (c) Make a basins of attraction plot (feel free to use your code from the corresponding lab) for Newton's method for the polynomial $z^3-1$, using the colours red, green and blue.  Add to your plot the points where Newton's method eventually fails (part (a)) in 1, 2 or 3 iterations. Use yellow for these points.  Also add the periodic points of period 1, 2 and 3, using white for these points. Use a scatter plot so you can set the size of the points. Make points where Newton's method eventually fails smaller if it takes more iterations for them to fail, similarly make periodic points of larger period smaller in your plot. Ensure your image has a resolution of 800x800. Use **%matplotlib inline** to ensure your images save to your notebook. \n"
