    "As for Quiz 1, create a new directory called `Assignment.1` in your own mp248 repository. Add all answer files to that directory, and add to your BitBucket repository. Our grading script will pull the assignment from there, starting around Monday morning. It will perform several tests on your assignment work as it becomes available. It is ok to submit work early, including partially finished work, so that you can get initial feedback through the automatic grading script. After the submission deadline, which is Friday Jan 26, TAs will manual grade your assignment and leave you with some comments. The graded assigments will be pushed back to your own mp248 BitBucket repository.\n",
