    "# Lab 2 - Newton basins of attraction\n",
    "    \n",
    "In class today we created the function\n",
    "\n",
    "    def plotNewt(f, x, x0):\n",
    "    \n",
    "that takes as input a function $f(x)$ and an initial value $x_0$.  It then creates a plot illustrating Newton's method. \n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed for functions like $x^2-2$, $\\cos(x)$ and $\\sin(x)$ that the root Newton's method finds depends to a large extent on the initial guess $x_0$.  The trend we saw from class was that:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) If $x_0$ is close-enough to a root, Newton's method converges very fast to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b) If $x_0$ is relatively far from roots, Newton's method may wander a large amount before settling down to a root.  It can also occasionally fail to find a root.  Mostly this seemed to occur when $x_i$ eventually was outside of the domain of the Newton iterator, and in all the instances we examined this was when $f'(x_i)$ was not defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part (A)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab we ask you to make a plot of pairs $(x_0, R(x_0))$ where $x_0$ is an initial value, and $R(x_0)$ is the root Newton's method converges to when given $x_0$ as its initial value. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you make progress on this project, you will need to make some decisions.  For example, if Newton's method fails, it perhaps makes the most sense not to plot a point $(x_0, R(x_0))$.  Similarly, you might find the values $R(x_0)$ are too large, so you might need to adjust your scale, or to make some other \"off scale\" convention. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do your plot for the three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (1) \\ \\ f(x) = x(x-1)(x+1)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ (3) \\ \\ f(x) = \\cos(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It perhaps makes sense to just make one routine that takes as input $f(x)$ as well as the $x$-axis interval you would like to perform your plot on.   For (1) make your interval $[-2,2]$.  For (2) make your interval $[-3\\pi, 3\\pi]$ and for (3) make your interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. \n"

    "Newton's method works in a wide variety of contexts other than functions of a single real variable.  People also apply it to functions of complex variables to solve complex equations such as $z^8 - z^2 + z - 2 =0$, and for functions of matrix variables to solve equations such as $A^4 - 3A^2 + 2A + I = 0$, where say $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix. \n",
